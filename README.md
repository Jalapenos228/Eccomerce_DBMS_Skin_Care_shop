Project Description 
This project includes the development of a database management system for an online skin care store. My main goal was to create a relational database solution that could effectively manage various e-commerce entities.The system will also include various procedures, functions, and triggers to enhance the functionality of the system. This document provides a comprehensive overview of our project, which includes an introduction, an Object Relationship Diagram (ERD), a relational schema, a detailed explanation of structure normal forms, and an overview of the SQL implementation.
